![BACKSPACE - Return to planet Figadore](../image-big.jpg?raw=true "BACKSPACE - Return to planet Figadore")

This was my second game jam entry, also my second HTML5/JS game. My first is available here [Planet Figadore has gone OFFLINE](https://github.com/picosonic/js13k-2018)

First of all just before the theme was announced I created a new project template with updated build and minify steps from my entry last year.

Once the theme was announced I had a bit of a thought about the kind of game I could create to fit the theme, these are some of my initial ideas ..

* Back to the moon - A moon lander game to celebrate 50 years since humans visited the moon.
* Return to planet Figadore - A continuation of my entry from last year where the player has to go back to their home planet.
* Don't turn back/Don't look back - A game where you're being chased by demons which you can't look into the eyes of.
* Get back on - A riding game where enemies try to knock you off your horse or bike.
* Back to basics - Using simple tools to solve complex problems.
* Back at the ranch - You're out of town when animals escape from your ranch (various reasons from careless postie to lightning) and have to race to get them back in.
* Back on track - A racing game where you can drive off the track for shortcuts but loose points for doing so.
* Back seat driver - A driving game where you play from the back seat.
* Back to square one - A puzzle where you start on a numbered square then are teleported to a random other square and have to get back to square one.
* Back door Bertie - A maze/chase game where you're being chased and enter various properties at the front door and need to navigate the maze of rooms to get to the back door to escape.
* Get back alive - Flight simulator to drop emergency aid in a warzone and you have to get back to your base in one piece.
* Send it back - Restaurant where you run the pass and have to decide if food can go out or has to be sent back to the kitchen.
* Back in my day - Time travel for present day character back to a "better" time, which of course has the same problems.
* Back of the bus/Back of the class - You play the part of a mischief maker where you sit at the back and have to play tricks on the teacher/driver whilst their back is turned.
* Get back in time for breakfast - Exploring some woods behind a summer camp where you see strange lights (aliens) and have to go find them and return before you're noticed missing.
* Back of the net - Football game where you aim to score in a major tournament.
* Back in the hole - A whack-a-mole type game with aliens in disguises which you hit and others which you don't.
